 * 
 * Create a new file called Button.js - weâ€™ll write our component code in here

Beautify your component
Making use of a separate CSS file, apply the following effects to your new button:

Text should be bolded and in a different font color (any is fine)

Button itself should be light blue

Button should have a thin border surrounding it (any thickness, any color)

Increase its font size (any is fine)

Increase the space between the actual button text and the border!
